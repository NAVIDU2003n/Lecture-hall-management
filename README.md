<br>

## 1. Project Overview

The **Lecture Hall Management System (LHMS)** is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage lecture halls, lecture schedules, and user access within a university environment. The system aims to eliminate scheduling conflicts, improve lecture hall utilization, and provide a centralized and reliable timetable management platform.

This project is developed as part of the **Software Engineering** module and follows a complete software engineering lifecycle, including requirement elicitation, system analysis, design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The development process follows **Agile (Scrum)** methodology and applies industry-standard software engineering best practices.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this system are:

- To provide a centralized platform for lecture hall and schedule management
- To prevent lecture hall booking conflicts through an approval-based workflow
- To support multiple stakeholders with role-based access control
- To demonstrate correct application of software engineering principles
- To develop a scalable, maintainable, and well-documented system

## 3. Scope of the System

### In Scope
- Lecture hall registration and management
- Lecture and event scheduling with conflict detection
- Role-based access control (Lecturer, Student, HOD, TO)
- Approval-based booking workflow
- Timetable viewing for lecturers and students
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Notification handling for schedule changes

### Out of Scope
- Online lecture delivery
- Attendance tracking
- Payment or billing functionality
- External LMS integrations

---
<br>

## 4. Stakeholders and User Roles

- **Lecturer**  
  Requests lecture halls, views personal timetables, and updates booking requests subject to approval.

- **Student**  
  Views personal lecture timetables and allocated lecture halls.

- **Head of Department (HOD)**  
  Reviews, approves, or rejects lecture hall booking requests and oversees departmental scheduling.

- **Technical Officer (TO)**  
  Verifies and approves user account registrations manually before system access is granted.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication  
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub  
- **Project Management**: Jira (Scrum-based workflow)

## 7. System Architecture

The system follows a **client–server architecture**:

- The React frontend provides role-based user interfaces
- The Node.js/Express backend handles business logic, validation, approvals, and notifications
- MongoDB is used for persistent data storage
- RESTful APIs are used for communication between client and server
- Authentication and authorization are enforced at the server level

This architecture promotes **low coupling**, **high cohesion**, and future scalability.
